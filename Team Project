-Our First Project:

SUSTAIN HR LTD.
Sustain HR Ltd. is a Human Resources Practices company that independently works of any other organisation and provides consultancy within its profession.
It is located within the business chains area of the city.Currently; it employs 150 workers. 
Due to the new pandemic regulations, the offices within the business chains area have to be disinfected based on the schedule given by the disinfection company. 
Based on the schedule, Sustain HR Ltd. has to empty its offices between 1 pm and 3 pm for the disinfection services to occur. 
Therefore; the Sustain HR Ltd.`s employees have stop doing their duties between 1pm and 3pm. 
In order to inform everyone, in case the employees lose track of the time, the security is commissioned to start the alarm for everyone to notice the time and leave.
The issue is that; the security forgets about the new regulations and do not seem to adapt. 
Therefore; Sustain HR Ltd.`s R&D department wants to create a code to implement and run in a program to start the alarm automatically.

The code for this problem:

import datetime
print (datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%H"))
print(datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%M"))
hour=int(input("Enter a Hour to Set Alarm: "))
minute=int(input("Enter a Minute to Set Alarm:: "))
while True:
    if hour == int(datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%H")) and minute == int(datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%M")):
        print ("Alarm Is Set")
        break

    else:
        print ("Alarm Is Set")
        break
        
        
-Our Second Project:

At our company SUSTAIN HR LTD, we want to ensure the security of the company's computers by programming a 
new password system on the computers used by our employees and managers. 
However, as a result of the survey we conducted with the employees, we saw that the employees forget their usernames and passwords very often, 
and therefore they have problems every time they log into their computers.
That's why we decided to program a software so that employees don't forget their passwords every time while ensuring the security of company computers. 
This software uses the computer's clock to generate the username and password accordingly. 
In other words, to log on to the computer, you must enter the current hour and minute as a username and password. 
Thus, employees will only need to look at the time to log in to computers. Time as username (e.g., 16 or 22) and minutes as password (e.g., 45 or 06).

The code for this problem:

import datetime
print ("Welcome SUSTAIN HR LTD")
print ("System Time:")
print (datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%H"))
print (datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%M"))
hour = int(input("Enter Your Username: "))
minute = int(input("Enter Your Password: "))
while True:
    if hour == int(datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%H")) and minute == int(datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%M")):
        print("Welcome")
        break
    else:
        print("Wrong Password")
        break
